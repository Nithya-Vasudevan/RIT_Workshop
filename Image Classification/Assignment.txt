Problem statement: Write a python program to classify 3 categories of flowers from IRIS dataset. We have 210 flower images.
Split the dataset into 3 groups namely, train set, validation set and test set with corresponding ratio, 7:2:1.
Hence, train set should have 147 images, validation set should have 42 and test set should have 21 images.
Train your model with training set and mention validation set to evaluate validation accuracy.  
Your code should accept an image from test set and predict the flower type (category/class).
